# 🐚 Nautilus

**Nautilus** is a **Rust-based** framework for developing **decentralized networks** and **secure communication systems**. It emphasizes **modularity, scalability, and privacy**, making it an ideal choice for exploring and building innovative network architectures.

🚀 **Goal:**  
To explore and develop a **modular structure** and frameworks aimed at experimentation and providing **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** solutions for **future-proofing** decentralized systems.

---

## ✨ Features

Nautilus provides a **rich set of features**, focusing on **privacy, security, and modularity**, empowering developers to build **next-generation decentralized solutions**.

- 🆔 **Decentralized Identity (DID):**  
  Create and manage decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.

- 🔑 **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):**  
  Secure communication with modular PKI components.

- 🔍 **Service Discovery:**  
  Efficient discovery of services and devices in a decentralized environment.

- 🔒 **Custom TLS with PQC:**  
  Implementation of **Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)** algorithms for secure identity-based transactions and **TLS encryption**.

- 🧩 **Modular Architecture:**  
  A **plug-and-play** architecture enabling each protocol/crate to be used independently in various scenarios.

## 📝 Take Note Of

Nautilus consists of **various Rust crates**, each serving as a **building block** that can be used **independently** or **together**. Each crate includes several important folders that developers should pay attention to:

- 📂 **`examples/` – Practical Usage Examples:**  
  - Contains simple, ready-to-run examples demonstrating how to utilize the protocol.  
  - **Tip:** Start here to get a quick understanding of implementation.

- 🧪 **`tests/` – Unit & Integration Tests:**  
  - Contains test cases that showcase how functions are used.  
  - **Tip:** Great for understanding function usage and expected outcomes.

- ⚡ **`benchmarks/` – Performance Insights:**  
  - Includes benchmarking tests to measure protocol performance, especially useful when dealing with cryptographic algorithms.  
  - **Tip:** Use this to analyze efficiency and scalability under different conditions.
